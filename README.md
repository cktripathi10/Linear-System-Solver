# Linear-System-Solver
In this assignment, I will implement the Gaussian elimination method, a foundational algorithm for solving systems of linear equations.

Linear algebra is fundamental to machine learning, serving as the basis for numerous algorithms. Gaussian elimination, while not the most advanced method used today, is a classical and essential technique for solving systems of linear equations. It provides valuable insights into the core principles of linear algebra and lays the groundwork for more advanced numerical methods.
